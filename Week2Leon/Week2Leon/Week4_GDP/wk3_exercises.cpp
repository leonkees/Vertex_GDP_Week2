/*

1.  Split our class into its own files  (.h   and .cpp) 

	Include them in the main.cpp file 
	Create a few objects :) 

2. Add New Features to the Class
	Add a method called ChargeBattery(int charge)
	that increases the battery life by the given amount (but doesn't let it go beyond 100%)

3. Simulate a Basic Phone Functionality
	Task: Add a method called MakeCall() that reduces the battery life by 5% each time it is called. 
	If the battery life is below 5%, the method should print a message saying "Low battery, please charge!"
	Don't decrease battery life / or kill phone , if phone is 0 nothing works.


4. Create a Class for a Different Object (WILL DO THIS IN THE GAME EXERCISE ALREADY)
	Create a new class of your own choosing , maybe think about an enemy or player class for a game ? 


5. Encapsulation Exercise: Getters and Setters
	 Create getter and setter methods for SerialNumber to enforce encapsulation.
	Objective: Reinforce the concept of encapsulation, where member variables are private, and you control access to them via methods.


5. Manipulating an Array of Objects
	Create an array (or std::vector) of Phone objects and write a loop to print out the information for each phone.
